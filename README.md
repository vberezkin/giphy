# giphy

Test app that shows Giphy content. It is based on Android MVVM architectural components and Paging library.

## Third-party dependencies

* OkHttp/Retrofit - almost standard libraries for typed HTTP requests.
* Glide - one of popular image loading libraries. One of its advertised features is smooth scrolling, so I chose it.
